Hi Mr. Davis, the pleasure was mine, about your question, I'm willing to help you but since my niche are higher skilled positions I'll have to decline the proposal

Hi, I would like to inform you about my latest accomplishments on the project, today I was able to design the login module and the development is about 50% complete, also could start testing the initiation module of the website, and finally I was able to setup the website with the hosting




My hard skills set are based mainly on programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and some MySql, I've used these tools to create dynamic web content, specially to manage web server side, data and the look of it, second I have design techniques which I've used shapes, colors, texture, typography, spaces and images to craft impressive mockups to develop websites.
